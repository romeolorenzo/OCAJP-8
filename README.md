I decided to take the OCAJP-8 exam at the end of month and using the "Oracle Certified Associate Java SE 8 Programmer I Study Guide" (ISBN 978-1-118-95740-0) and "OCA/OCP Java SE 8 Programmer Practice Tests" (ISBN 978-1-119-36339-2) by Jeanne Boyarsky and Scott Selikoff.  This repository is a collection of my notes based for the 1Z0-808 exam.
